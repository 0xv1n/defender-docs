# What's new in Microsoft's unified security operations platform

<!--Need to define when something goes here versus other what's new articles. Maybe we just focus on updates within this library and things tied directly to USX (features that unblock onboarding, parity features with Sentinel, enhancements to core USX features?) -->

This article lists recent features added into the Microsoft's unifed SecOps platform within the Microsoft Defender portal, and new features in related services that provide an enhanced user experience in the platform.

The listed features were released in the last three months. For information about earlier features delivered, see our [Tech Community blogs](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-sentinel/bg-p/AzureSentinelBlog/label-name/What's%20New).
