# What is Microsoft's unified security operations platform?

Microsoft's unified security operations platform provides a single platform for end-to-end security operations (SecOps). 

- Reduce risk and prevent attacks with integrated exposure management.
- Detect and disrupt cyberthreats in near-real time across domain like endpoints, identities, email and collaboration tools, cloud apps, data stores, and hybrid infrastructure.
- Investigate and respond faster with generative AI solutions that innovate and enhance security capabilities.

Microsoft's unified SecOps platform combines services like [Microsoft Defender XDR](/defender-xdr/microsoft-365-defender), [Microsoft Sentinel](/azure/sentinel/overview), [Microsoft Security Exposure Management](/security-exposure-management/microsoft-security-exposure-management), and [Microsoft Security Copilot](/copilot/security/microsoft-security-copilot) in the [Microsoft Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com). The Defender portal provides a single location to monitor, detect, investigate, remediate, and respond against prebreach and postbreach cybersecurity risks and threats.

## Protect assets

Protect a wide range of assets with the integration of Defender products in Microsoft's unified SecOps platform.

|Capability  |Security product  |
|---------|---------|
|Protect against threats posed by email messages, URL links, and Office 365 collaboration tools.     |   Defender for Office 365      |
|Monitor and protect endpoint devices. Monitor, detect, and investigate device breaches, and automatically respond to security threats.    |     Microsoft Defender for Endpoint    |
|Identify assets and software inventory, and assess device posture to find security vulnerabilities.|Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management|
|Protect and control access to SaaS cloud apps.|Defender for Cloud Apps|
|Identify, detect, and investigate Microsoft Entra ID threats.|Defender for Identity|
|Improve multicloud and on-premises security posture, and protect cloud workloads against threats.|Microsoft Defender for Cloud|
|Discover and assess assets, and remediate risk to reduce attack surfaces.|Microsoft Security Exposure Management|
|Identify and protect OT/IT resources by extending Defender XDR protection to OT environments.|Microsoft Defender for IoT|

## Simplify security management

Use combined security services for end-to-end pre and post breach protection of endpoints, identities, cloud apps and workloads, and email across your organization.

The Defender portal provides a single, centralized view of organizational security posture and threat detections and response. It provides a combined incidents queue that groups together information about security risks and breaches.

Free up analyst time as unified security dashboards enable analysts to cross organization silos, prioritize the most critical threats, and hunt effectively for attempted breaches.

## Reduce security risk and prevent attacks

Consistently reducing security risk and preventing cybersecurity attacks is an important part of your organizational risk management framework. Microsoft's unified SecOps platform offers comprehensive exposure management and cloud protection capabilities. With Microsoft Security Exposure Management, and Microsoft Defender for Cloud:

- Continuously discover organizational assets and assess their security posture.  
- Protect cloud workloads from code to runtime.
- Aggregate data and threat intelligence to discover security gaps and weaknesses, including analysis of potential attack paths.
- Investigate and query to get insights into security posture.
- Prioritize asset remediation, with the focus on critical resources, to reduce security gaps and attack surfaces.

## Reduce threat detection and response times

Standard cybersecurity metrics focus on the time to detect (TTD) and time to respond (TTR). Time to detect (TTD) measures how long it takes security teams to discover an incident. Time to respond (TTR) measures the amount of time it takes to respond after a threat is detected. The shorter the TTD and TTR, the more effective your detection, and response strategy is.

Microsoft's unified SecOps platform correlates millions of signals from Defender products, Microsoft security research, and threat intelligence to identify attacks in progress. It initiates automatic attack disruption to automatically contain attacks, limiting lateral movement early, and reduce attack impact. Automatic attack disruption helps to reduce costs associated with loss of productivity, provide control to the SecOps team control to investigate and remediate compromised assets.

Automatic attack disruption responds to threats by containing devices and containing/disabling users to mitigate attacks.

## Transform SOC productivity

Microsoft Security Copilot brings together the power of AI and human expertise to help your SOC team respond to attacks faster and more effectively. Security Copilot is embedded in the Defender portal to enable security teams to efficiently summarize incidents, analyze scripts and codes, analyze files, summarize device information, use guided responses to resolve incidents, generate KQL queries, and create incident reports. Security Copilot helps you to:

- **Reduce exposure and improve posture**. Prevent breaches with insights to uncover critical exposure risk, and risk reduction recommendations.
- **Prevent and disrupt threats**. Identify and prioritize with incident summaries MITRE ATT&CK framework mapping, and automatic alert enrichment.
- **Empower analysts**:
    - Accelerate incident resolution with guided responses, automated remediation, and summary report generation.
    - Provide intelligent assistance with tailored prompts based on best practices that analyze malicious scripts and files, and suggest KQL queries.
