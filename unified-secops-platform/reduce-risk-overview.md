# Overview - Improve security posture and reduce security risk

To battle increasingly bold, sophisticated, and well-resourced threat actors, security teams need a comprehensive strategy to both reduce vulnerabilities and prevent breaches before they occur, and to detect and mitigate threats in real-time.

Microsoft's unified security platform provides a set of integrated tools and processes that work together to help security teams proactively reduce security risk.

## Security risk management

Enterprise risk management frameworks identify, evaluate, manage, and mitigate all kinds of risks that an organization might face. Risks come from lots of areas, including operational risk, strategic risk, legal risk, or IT and compliance risk.

At the organizational level, a board of directors often oversees the risk framework, with business leaders responsible for framework management and for company culture around risk management, including:

- **Setting an organizational risk tolerance**: The organization's the willingness to bear risk.
- **Setting an organizational risk appetite**: The organization's acceptable level of risk in the pursuit of business objectives.

It's essential to include security risk in the organizational risk framework as security risk is intertwined into most areas of the business and often isn't the responsibility of a single team. Managing security risk as both a security and business function helps ensure that:

- Security risks are surfaced in a business context, to align security with business goals, including risk tolerance and appetite.
- Management of cybersecurity risk becomes an integral part of the business planning, prioritizaton, budgeting,and disaster preparation.

## Pre-breach risk reduction

Taking a proactive approach to security, before breaches happen, helps frame security as an ongoing risk that must be managed, rather than a one-time technical problem to be solved. It also reduces the likelihood of an attack, and helps mitigates lack of preparation that might result in major business disruption.

Microsoft strategies and technologies contribute to the key activities essential to improving enterprise security posture and reducing risk before attacks occur.

**Activity** | **Details**

- **Protecting assets and workloads**: Cloud security posture management helps to protect cloud workloads from code to runtime by continually assessing and remediating workload configurations.
**Discovering and assessing assets** | Discovering and assessing your assets is the first step in understanding your security posture.<br/><br/>By creating a comprehensive resource inventory, you can identify what needs protection and where potential vulnerabilities might exist.<br/><br/>Discovery and assessment must be continuously integrated into a centralized, up-to-date inventory, with ongoing assessment continuously identifying key areas for improvement with detailed, actionable security recommendations.
**Aggregating security data** | Aggregate data and threat intelligence to discover security gaps and weaknesses, including potential attack paths.
**Adhering to compliance standards** | Compliance standards provide structured, well-known guidelines around security controls and measures. Adhering to these standards ensures that your organization meets regulatory requirements 
**Investigating posture** | Investigate and query across resources to get deep insights into security posture to answer questions such as - How secure are we? How are we doing over time? Where do we stand on mitigation? Are we protected against the latest threats?
**Managing findings and remediation** | rioritize asset remediation, with focus on critical resources, to reduce security gaps and attack surfaces.<br/><br/> To remediate findings, you need an owner to fix them, and a validation process to ensure that issues are addressed.
**Measuring progress** | Measure how you're doing in specific areas of security. Measure you're accomplishing goals and maintaing compliance in areas of most important to you.
**Continuously improving**** |  Use security posture management to provide fast and continuous feedback to the risk management frameworks, 

## Improve prebreach security

It's tough to get a full inventory and understanding of comprehensive security posture across an organizational digital estate in order to reduce security risk. Security teams must:

- Inventory and track all kinds of assets and workloads, as well as complex connections and interactions between users, devices, data, and systems. 
- Collect data and correlate signals from multiple siloed sources, to arrive at a single accurate contextual representation of each digital asset.
- Use tools that provide insights into misconfigurations and security posture drift tied to existing and newly-discovered vulnerabilities and exposures.
- Effectively deploy security programs and tools to mitigate identified risks, and prioritize remediations that have the highest impact on reducing attack surface area.

A range of solutions within Microsoft's unified security operations platform helps security teams to complete all of these tasks, in order to protect all organizational assets across the business, and across the full security lifecycle


**Solution** | **Details** | **Capabilities**
--- | --- | ---
**Microsoft Security Exposure Management**<br/><br/>Reduce security risk by proactively optimizing security posture. | - Automatically discover assets, including devices, identities, cloud apps, and more. Extend visiblitiy by connecting to non-Microsoft solutions.<br/><br/>- Aggregate security posture data from Microsoft and other vendors to consolidate disparate data silos into a single location.<br/><br/>- Organize data into common and customized security intiatives to monitor, track, measure, and prioritize posture in specific areas of the business.<br/><br/> - Identify, classify, and protect critical business assets to reduce the likelihood of them being attacked.<br/><br/>Discover attack surfaces. Map and visualize attack surfaces and threat impact radius.<br/><br/>-Understand and analyze potential attack paths to map how vulnerabilities might be exploited by attackers across the organization.<br/><br/> Get insights into security posture. Analyze data to understand, prioritize, and mitigate security risk.
**Microsoft Defender for Cloud**<br/><br/> Detect real-time threats to cloud workloads, and proactively improve security posture. | - Cloud security posture management capabilities provide visibility into the security posture of resources across Azure, AWS, GCP, and on-premises, including machines, containers, sensitive data, databases, AI workloads, storage, and DevOps.<br/><br/> Security recommendations provide information and manual/automatic actions to remediate issues and harden resource security. 
**Microsoft XDR**<br/><br/> Provides real-time threat protection, and some security posture capabilities for Microsft 365 environments, including, devices, identities, email, and collaboration apps. | Defender for Endpoint in Defender XDR reduces attack surfaces with features such as hardware-based isolation, application control, controlled folder access, network protection, exploit protection, and attack surface reduction rules.<br/><br/>- Defender Vulnerability Management continuously identifies vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, providing contextual insights into potential threats, and recommendations to mitigate them.
