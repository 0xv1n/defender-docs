# Improving security posture and reducing security risk

To battle increasingly sophisticated and well-resourced threat actors, security teams need a comprehensive strategy to both reduce vulnerabilities and prevent breaches before they occur, in addition to detecting and mitigating threats in real-time.

Microsoft's unified SecOps platform provides a set of integrated tools and solutions that work together to help security teams proactively reduce security risk.

## Managing security risk

Managing security risk is an essential part of your organizational risk framework.

When you take a proactive approach to security, before breaches happen, it helps frame security as an ongoing risk that must be managed. It also reduces the likelihood of security attacks and mitigates the likelihood of major business disruptions when attacks occur.


## Improving prebreach security

There are many challenges in understanding and improving security posture. Security teams must address many key activities to meet those challenges.

**Activity** | **Details**
--- | ---
**Protect workloads across clouds** | Proactive security posture management helps to protect cloud workloads from code to runtime by continually assessing and remediating cloud workload configurations.
**Discover and track assets** | Discovering and assessing your assets is the first step in understanding organizational security posture.<br/><br/>Capturing discovered assets into a central and up-to-date inventory provides unified and broad visibility into security posture.
**Understand asset connections** | In addition to continuously discovering and tracking assets, security teams must understand and be able to visualize complex connections and interactions between users, devices, data, and systems. 
**Aggregate asset data** | Collecting data and correlating signals from multiple siloed sources, to arrive at a single accurate contextual representation of each digital asset helps security teams to discover security gaps and weaknesses, including potential attack paths.
**Get security insights** | Investigating and querying across assets to get deep insights into misconfigurations and security posture drift as risks change helps security teams to answer questions such as - How secure are we? How are we doing over time? Where do we stand on mitigation? What areas are weakest? Are we protected against the latest threats?
**Adhere to compliance standards** | Compliance standards provide structured, well-known guidelines around security controls and measures. Adhering to these standards ensures that your organization meets regulatory requirements.
**Manage findings and remediation** | Prioritizing asset remediation by focusing on critical resources helps you to reduce security gaps and attack surfaces in the most important areas of your business.
**Measure progress** | Measure how you're doing in specific areas of security to help accomplish goals and maintain compliance in critical areas.
**Continuously improve** |  Use security posture management to provide fast and continuous feedback to the risk management frameworks
