# Hunting in the Microsoft unified security platform



Need to answer this for reader - How is hunting differentiated from detection?
Threat intelligence helps detect threats, but infrastructure chaining is a type of hunt

Hunting is proactive activity, but can also be reactive. More flexible tools to use complex ideas and patterns. Hunting can also include finding gaps.
