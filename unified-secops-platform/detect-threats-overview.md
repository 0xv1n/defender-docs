# Threat detection in Microsoft's unified SecOps platform

Cybersecurity threats abound in the current technology landscape. A lot of noise is created though by this constant spectre of breach and an abundance of signals available to security operation centers. Microsoft's unified SecOps platform separates the noise from actionable threats. Each service in Microsoft's unified SecOps platform adds its own finely tuned detections to match the complexion of the solution it provides all together into a single dashboard.

The more services that send data to Microsoft's unified security platform, the greater the focus and clarity your security teams have to understand and prioritize a response. With near-real time detections and automated responses, high confidence threats are neutralized quickly.

## Microsoft Defender XDR threat detection

Security teams need focus and clarity to eliminate false positives. Microsoft Defender XDR correlates and merges alerts and incidents from its suite of security services as well as unifying threat detection from Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft Defender for Cloud. The correlation and merging of these signals brings rich context and prioritization. For example, an Adversary-in-The-Middle (AiTM) phishing attack might have pieces of the threat puzzle scattered across multiple sources. Defender XDR puts those pieces together into an attack story while providing attack disrupt and guided response to remediate the threat.

For the current list of Microsoft security products that natively add their detections to Microsoft Defender XDR, see [What is Microsoft Defender XDR?](/defender-xdr/microsoft-365-defender). For each of those Microsoft security products enabled, more signals are unlocked and streamed into Defender XDR.

For more information on how these signals are stitched together and prioritized, see [Incidents and alerts in the Microsoft Defender portal](/defender-xdr/incidents-overview).

## Microsoft Sentinel threat detection

Microsoft Sentinel enables data collection from all your Microsoft and third party sources, but doesn't stop there. With Microsoft Sentinel's threat management capabilities, you gain the tools needed to detect and organize threats to your environment.

| Threat management feature | Detection capability | For more information |
|---|---|---|
| MITRE ATT&CK coverage | Organize your threat detection coverage and understand gaps. | [Understand security coverage by the MITRE ATT&CKÂ® framework](/azure/sentinel/mitre-coverage) |
| Analytics | Rules constantly dig through your data to generate alerts and incidents and integrates those signals in the Defender portal. | [Detect threats out-of-the-box](/azure/sentinel/threat-detection) |
| Watchlists | Curate meaningful relationships in your environment to improve the quality and prioritization of detections. | [Watchlists in Microsoft Sentinel](/azure/sentinel/watchlists) |
| Workbooks | Detect threats with visual insights, especially to monitor the health of your data collection and understand gaps that prevent proper threat detection. | [Visualize your data with workbooks](/azure/sentinel/monitor-your-data?tabs=defender-portal) |



## Microsoft Defender for Cloud threat detection

Defender for Cloud provides threat detection to generate alerts and incidents by continuously monitoring your clouds' assets with advanced security analytics. Those signal are integrated directly into Microsoft Defender XDR for correlation and severity classification. Although Defender for cloud is licensed separately from Defender for XDR, additional plans enabled in Defender for Cloud add to the detection signals streamed into Defender XDR.

For more information, see [Security alerts and incidents](/azure/defender-for-cloud/alerts-overview).
