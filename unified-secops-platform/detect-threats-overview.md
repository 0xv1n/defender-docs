# Threat detection in Microsoft's unified SecOps platform

Cybersecurity threats abound in the current technology landscape. A lot of noise is created by the constant spectre of breach and an abundance of signals available to security operation centers. Microsoft's unified SecOps platform separates actionable threats from the noise. Each service in Microsoft's unified SecOps platform adds its own finely tuned detections to match the complexion of the solution it provides and puts it all together into a single dashboard.

The more services that send data to Microsoft's unified security platform, the greater the focus and clarity your security teams have to understand and prioritize a response. High confidence threats are neutralized quickly with near-real time detections and automated responses to neutralize high confidence threats quickly.

## Microsoft Defender XDR threat detection

Security teams need focus and clarity to eliminate false positives. Microsoft Defender XDR correlates and merges alerts and incidents from its suite of security services as well as unifying threat detection from Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft Defender for Cloud. The correlation and merging of these signals brings rich context and prioritization. For example, an Adversary-in-The-Middle (AiTM) phishing attack might have pieces of the threat puzzle scattered across multiple sources. Defender XDR puts those pieces together into an attack story while providing attack disrupt and guided response to remediate the threat.

| Defender XDR service | Threat detection specialty |
|---|---|
| [**Microsoft Defender for Endpoint**](/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-endpoint) | Microsoft Defender antivirus detects polymorphic malware with behavior-based and heuristic analytics on endpoints such as mobile devices, desktops and more.|
| [**Microsoft Defender for Office 365**](/defender-office-365/mdo-about#defender-for-office-365-plan-1-vs-plan-2-cheat-sheet) | Detects phishing, malware, weaponized links in email, Teams and OneDrive.|
| [**Microsoft Defender for Identity**](/defender-for-identity/what-is) | Detects privilege escalation, lateral movement, discovery, defense evasion, persistence and more across on-prem identities.|
| [**Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps**](/defender-cloud-apps/what-is-defender-for-cloud-apps) | Detects suspicious activities through user and entity behavioral analytics (UEBA) across cloud applications.|
| [**Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management**](/defender-vulnerability-management/defender-vulnerability-management) | Detects vulnerabilities in devices providing meaningful context for investigations.|
| [**Microsoft Entra ID Protection**](/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/overview-identity-protection) | Detects risks associated with sign-ins like impossible travel, verified threat actor IP, leaked credentials, password sprays and more.| 
| [**Microsoft Data Loss Prevention**](/microsoft-365/compliance/dlp-learn-about-dlp) | Detects risks and behavior associated with oversharing and exfiltration of sensitive information across M365 services, Office applications, endpoints and more.|
| [**App Governance**](/defender-cloud-apps/app-governance-manage-app-governance) | Detects anomalies in cloud app activity, especially when noncompliant, malicious, or risky apps are used.|

Each Microsoft security product enabled unlocks more signals to stream into Defender XDR. For more information on how these signals are stitched together and prioritized, see [Incidents and alerts in the Microsoft Defender portal](/defender-xdr/incidents-overview).

## Microsoft Sentinel threat detection

Microsoft Sentinel enables data collection from all your Microsoft and third party sources, but doesn't stop there. With Microsoft Sentinel's threat management capabilities, you gain the tools needed to detect and organize threats to your environment.

| Threat management feature | Detection capability | For more information |
|---|---|---|
| MITRE ATT&CK coverage | Organize your threat detection coverage and understand gaps. | [Understand security coverage by the MITRE ATT&CKÂ® framework](/azure/sentinel/mitre-coverage) |
| Analytics | Rules constantly dig through your data to generate alerts and incidents and integrates those signals in the Defender portal. | [Detect threats out-of-the-box](/azure/sentinel/threat-detection) |
| Watchlists | Curate meaningful relationships in your environment to improve the quality and prioritization of detections. | [Watchlists in Microsoft Sentinel](/azure/sentinel/watchlists) |
| Workbooks | Detect threats with visual insights, especially to monitor the health of your data collection and understand gaps that prevent proper threat detection. | [Visualize your data with workbooks](/azure/sentinel/monitor-your-data?tabs=defender-portal) |

For more information, see [Detect threats in Microsoft Sentinel](/azure/sentinel/overview?tabs=azure-portal#detect-threats).

## Microsoft Defender for Cloud threat detection

Defender for Cloud provides threat detection to generate alerts and incidents by continuously monitoring your clouds' assets with advanced security analytics. Those signal are integrated directly into Microsoft Defender XDR for correlation and severity classification. Although Defender for cloud is licensed separately from Defender for XDR, additional plans enabled in Defender for Cloud add to the detection signals streamed into Defender XDR.
