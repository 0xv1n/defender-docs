# Overview - Detect threats

Threat intelligence helps detect threats, but infrastructure chaining is a type of hunt

Threat detection vs. threat protection
Sentinel - /azure/sentinel/threat-detection
Defender XDR - defender-xdr/incident-response-overview [looking at narrower slice here though to focus on detection vs. the response]
Defender for Cloud - Threat detection - Accurate matching of virtual entities to device entities to ensure precision and effective threat detection.
