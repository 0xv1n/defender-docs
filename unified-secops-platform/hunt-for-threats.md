Need to answer this for reader - How is hunting differentiated from detection?
Hunting is proactive activity, but can also be reactive. More flexible tools to use complex ideas and patterns. Hunting can also include finding gaps.

Advanced hunting, custom detections, hunts in Sentinel
Sentinel - /azure/sentinel/hunting
Defender XDR - /defender-xdr/advanced-hunting-overview
Defender for Cloud - Advanced hunting (Preview) Information about cloud audit events for various cloud platforms protected by the organization's Defender for Cloud is available through the CloudAuditEvents table in advanced hunting.
