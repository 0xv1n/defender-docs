# Unified security operations platform planning overview

This article outlines activities for planning a deployment of Microsoft's unified security operations platform for end-to-end security operations (SecOps). Microsoft's unified security operations platform helps you reduce risk, prevent attacks, detect and disrupt cyberthreats in real time, and respond faster with AI-enhanced security capabilities, all from the [Microsoft Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com).

<!--need to update links so that they stay in the TOC if we're including them-->

## Review service prerequisites

The unified security operations platform pulls Microsoft Sentinel and several Microsoft Defender services together in the Microsoft Defender portal. Make sure to review prerequisites for each of the following services that you'll be using:

- **Microsoft Sentinel**: [Prerequisites to deploy Microsoft Sentinel](/azure/sentinel/prerequisites)
- **Microsoft Defender XDR and Microsoft Defender for Office 365**: [Microsoft Defender XDR prerequisites](/defender-xdr/prerequisites)
- **Microsoft Defender for Identity**: [Microsoft Defender for Identity prerequisites](/defender-for-identity/deploy/prerequisites)
- **Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps**: [Get started with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/defender-cloud-apps/get-started)
- **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint**: [Set up Microsoft Defender for Endpoint deployment](/defender-endpoint/production-deployment)

Complete your deployment planning by checking prerequisites for both Microsoft Entra ID Protection and Microsoft Defender for Cloud, which are separate from Microsoft Defender XDR and Microsoft Sentinel. For more information, see:

- **Microsoft Entra ID Protection**: [Plan an ID Protection deployment](/entra/id-protection/how-to-deploy-identity-protection?form=MG0AV3)
- **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**: [Start planning multicloud protection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/plan-multicloud-security-get-started) and other articles in the same section.

## Design a governence strategy

<!--shared from zt / ops content-->

If your organization has many Azure subscriptions, you might need a way to efficiently manage access, policies, and compliance for those subscriptions, especially when keeping Zero Trust principles in mind. Management groups provide a governance scope for subscriptions. When you organize your subscriptions within management groups, the governance conditions you configure for a management group apply to the subscriptions it contains. For more information, see Organize your resources with management groups.

For example, the Microsoft Sentinel workspace in the following diagram is in the Security subscription under the Platform management group, which is part of the Microsoft Entra ID tenant.

## Plan your Log Analytics workspace architecture

To use Microsoft Sentinel, you need a Log Analytics workspace. A single Log Analytics workspace might be sufficient for many environments, but many organizations create multiple workspaces to optimize costs and better meet different business requirements.

We recommend creating separate workspaces for the operational and security data for data ownership and cost management for Microsoft Sentinel. For example, if thereâ€™s more than one person administering operational and security roles, your first decision for Zero Trust is whether to create separate workspaces for those roles.

The unified security operations platform, which provides access to Microsoft Sentinel in the Defender portal, supports only a single workspace. <!--isn't this no longer true? if so we need to update in ZT too-->

Design the Log Analytics workspace you want to enable for Microsoft Sentinel. Consider parameters such as:

- Whether you'll use a single tenant or multiple tenants
- Any compliance requirements you have for data collection and storage
- How to control access to Microsoft Sentinel data

## Prioritize data connectors

Determine which data sources you need and the data size requirements to help you accurately project your deployment's budget and timeline.

You might determine this information during your business use case review, or by evaluating a current SIEM that you already have in place. If you already have a SIEM in place, analyze your data to understand which data sources provide the most value and should be ingested into Microsoft Sentinel.

For more information, see [Prioritize data connectors](/azure/sentinel/prioritize-data-connectors).

## Plan roles and permissions

Use Azure role based access control (RBAC) to create and assign roles within your security operations team to grant appropriate access to services incuded in the Microsoft Sentinel and. The different roles give you fine-grained control over what Microsoft Sentinel users can see and do. Azure roles can be assigned in the workspace directly, or in a subscription or resource group that the workspace belongs to, which Microsoft Sentinel inherits.

## Plan Microsoft Sentinel costs

Start planning your budget, considering cost implications for each planned scenario. Make sure that your budget covers the cost of data ingestion for both Microsoft Sentinel and Azure Log Analytics, any playbooks that will be deployed, and so on.
