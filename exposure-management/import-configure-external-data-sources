# Work with external data sources

There are several steps to prepare and configure your external data sources in Microsoft Security Exposure Management (MSEM). This article provides an overview of the process and the types of assets and data that can be imported into MSEM.

## Imported Assets and Types

The Microsoft Security Exposure Management solution includes various types of assets. These assets are aimed at enhancing the company's digital presence and improving customer engagement.

- Devices
- Vulnerabilities
- Users (future)
- Software (future)
- SaaS Applications (future)

The asset information imported into MSEM includes data from external data sources like Qualys, Rapid7, and ServiceNow CMDB environments. This data is consolidated into MSEM, to provide a comprehensive view of the security posture across all digital assets.

The imported assets appear in the inventories and the exposure graph. Microsoft Security Exposure Management also offers integration with critical asset protection, attack paths, metrics, and initiatives. It provides insights into potential attack paths and entry points that could compromise critical assets. It also offers metrics and recommendations to help prioritize actions to protect these assets.

The information brought into the system includes:

- Device and service data from systems, including OS
- Distribution
- Interfaces
- Network details
- Last users

## Configuring your data sources/connections

After you prepare the connection for the supported external data sources, follow these steps:

1. Complete the applicable prerequisite steps for your data sources.
2. To connect your data sourceâ€™s environment, go to [Data Connectors](https://security.microsoft.com/exposure-data-connectors) from the MSEM navigation.
